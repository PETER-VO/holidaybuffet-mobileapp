This app uses to improve food and grow the restaurant business. The app's primary purpose is to pull customers back with attractive vouchers, and the manager will use the scan QR-code function to verify the QR-code of this voucher is valid or not and the check-in number of every time that guest comes to eat. Moreover, customers will give points and evaluate dishes to help the restaurant improve them better.
